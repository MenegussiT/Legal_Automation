# Project: Legal Automation

## Objective of the Code
The developed code automates tasks in the Sulamerica system using the Selenium and Pandas libraries in Python, along with the Openpyxl library for Excel file handling. The main functionalities include reading data from an Excel file, logging into the system, navigating through different pages, filling out forms, and manipulating web elements.

## Used Libraries
- **Pandas**: Used for reading data from the Excel file, manipulating it, and creating DataFrames.
- **Selenium**: Used for automating interactions with the web browser.
- **Time**: Used to introduce pauses in the code, ensuring that actions are performed at the correct time.
- **OpenpyXL**: Used for manipulation and reading of Excel files (XLS or XLSX).

## Code Flow
1. **Read Excel File:**
   - The code uses the Pandas and Openpyxl libraries to read data from an Excel file named "LAYOUT SAUDE_RODAR1.xlsx" and prints the content.

2. **Browser Configuration:**
   - Configuration of the Chrome browser service using WebDriver Manager.
   - Initialization of the Chrome browser.

3. **Login to the System:**
   - Use of a loop to perform login into the system. If an exception occurs (NoSuchElementException), the code retries with an alternative set of credentials.

4. **Iteration with Excel Data:**
   - Use of a loop to iterate over the rows of the DataFrame read from Excel.
   - For each row, the code performs a series of actions in the Sulamerica system, such as filling in fields, selecting options, and clicking buttons.

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - A try-except block is used to handle the NoSuchElementException exception, allowing the code to continue execution in case of an error.

6. **Expired Session Handling:**
   - Check for the existence of an element indicating an expired session. If detected, the code confirms the session to continue.

7. **Re-login in Case of Logout:**
   - Check if the system has logged out. If yes, the code performs a re-login with a specific set of credentials.

## Notes
- The code uses XPath to locate elements on the page. It is recommended to periodically check for changes in the page structure that may impact these XPath selectors.
- It is important to keep the libraries (Pandas, Selenium, Openpyxl, etc.) installed and up-to-date to ensure the correct functioning of the code.
